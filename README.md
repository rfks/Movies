# Movies

As part of the Udacity/Google Android development course this is my version of the Popular Movies app. It was based on various code that was shared from Udacity during this and the Beginner Android course.

To run this code you need to have your own API Key which can be created at 

https://www.themoviedb.org/account/signup

and adding it to the MainActivity.java file.
